<h2>HOW TO ADD MORE LETTERS TO THIS FONT</h2>
<p>FiRST OF ALL, LOWERCASE LETTERS ARE COMPLETELY MISSING. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO CREATE A VALID FONT USING FREE ONLINE DATASETS, SINCE THE PURPOSE OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO ENABLE ANYONE TO CREATE THE FONTS FROM THEIR OWN HANDWRITING.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE - THE MORE ATTENTION AND IS GIVEN TO ADJUSTING THE FONT DETAILS THROUGH THE "step4_Editor.py" FILE, THE BETTER THE RESULT - OUTPUT PRINTED IMAGE - BECOMES.</p>
